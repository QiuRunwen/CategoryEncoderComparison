Farm Laborer Column 2 is son's occupation, coded in the same way as father's. Column 3 is family structure, coded 1=intact family background and 2=nonintact family background. Column 4 is race, coded 1=white and 2=black. Column 5 is counts for son's first occupation. Column 6 is counts for son's current occupation.
