700 good and 300 bad credits with 20 predictor variables. Data from 1973 to 1975. Stratified sample from actual credits with bad credits heavily oversampled. A cost matrix can be used.

The widely used Statlog German credit data (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Statlog+%28German+Credit+Data%29), as of November 2019, suffers from severe errors in the coding information and does not come with any background information. The 'South German Credit' data provide a correction and some background information, based on the Open Data LMU (2010) representation of the same data and several other German language resources.
